- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KFR197
I'm a film editor who unfortunately is working with the Latest version of FCPX (DISASTER)
I'm originally an AVID instructer but moved on to FCP some yars ago.
Never had the kind of problems that I'm experiencing NOW.
I can't believe that Apple would release a program as buggy as this.
